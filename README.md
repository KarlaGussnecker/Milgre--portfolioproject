This project was made for a friend to showcase her techical writing and drawing skills. It is not complete with all the necessary content yet but will be updated as soon as everything is provided. The page is responsive on both small and large screens and was made mainly using HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.

The landing page aka 'Home' section has a GIF as the main image. The navigation bar is made in such a way that it's not displayed on small screens in order for the user to get a better view of the images and on larger screens you can navigate with it, having also the option to just scroll through everything.
<br>
Most of the elements throughout the website are animated on scroll and that overall gives a more dynamic effect and simply makes everything look nicer in my opinion. For that I visited this [AOS website](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) where you can find different options that will enhance any user experience.

 <br>
In the 'Portfolio' section there are some cards with the authors drawings inside and each one has a 'Read More' option that takes you to a separate page for more details. For now only the 'FAQ' card has the actual content and the rest just have random images.

<br>

Lastly there is a 'Contact' section where I've built a fully functional form using [FORMSUBMIT](https://formsubmit.co) so that the owner of the page will get an email anytime someone wants to get in touch.

<br>

On the bottom side of the form I've imported some icons using [Line Awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) that will eventually be updated and lead to the authors social pages.

The project is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and you can check it out [HERE](https://milgre-asis.vercel.app)
